# c-ds-algos

A commented collection of Datastructures and Algorithms implementations written in C plus some notes I took while writing them.

## What's this repo about

When I learn a new language I usually go through algorithms and data-structures as if I was learning them for the first time. I find it really useful especially to get comfortable with the langage I am learning.

This time I have decided to share the code I wrote following various books and sources I have used in the past with different languages. This is not a curated and in-depth collection of every possible data structure or algorithm ever developed but it's what a beginner in this language wrote until he got comfortable with it. Most of the code is commented following a standard and I prioritized readable code over concise code.

Alongside code there are some `explaination.md` files that contain the notes I took while going through this topic, they aren't complete because this isn't my first time learning about this topic and writing everything as if it was my first time was exagerrated.

## NOTES

English is not my first language so if you find errors feel free to fix them, I am open to any kind of PR and feedback.
